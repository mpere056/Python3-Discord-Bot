# Python3-Discord-Bot
This is a multipurpose discord bot I made using discord.py and various other libraries.
The main purpose of my bot is to learn how I can use my linux based vps with my bot.

Here's what the bot can do so far:

- Screenshot Webpages
  - usage: screenshot [website] <and wait for [amount of seconds] seconds>
  - ex. screenshot https://youtube.com and wait 2 seconds
  
- Screenshot Messages
  - usage: test1 <number of messages above the current message>
  - ex. test1 1 
  
- Assign roles
  - ex. give pbot the role Bot

- Execute bash commands
  - ex. bash ls -o

- Return osu signatures
  - ex. osu pbot mania

- Greentext
  - ex. >you can't greentext on discord?

- Kick people
  - ex. kick pbot
