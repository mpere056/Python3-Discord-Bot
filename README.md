# Python3-Discord-Bot
This is a multipurpose discord bot I made using discord.py and various other libraries.
The main purpose of my bot is to learn how I can use my linux based vps with my bot.

Here's what the bot can do so far:

- Screenshot Messages
  
- Screenshot Webpages
  
- Assign roles

- Execute bash commands

- Return osu signatures

- Greentext

- Kick people
